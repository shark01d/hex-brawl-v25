### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- tinydb

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`py main.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. 
Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/rWgjlIqK#wpJ03aqEDLvOqCJN9uV6W-7LYEvudBrsiMHQ447mFfg) (most likely won't work on Android 10+) and change the IP in `libgg.config.so`

### Special thanks
- [TheAcelot](https://github.com/theacelot) - for making the server.

### Client Help
If you found a way to replace frida gadget (libgg.so), please, text me in dm: https://t.me/shark01d
